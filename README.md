## Installation

- composer install 
- php artisan serve.

## Improvements

- Get iso time from user not utc time
- Make a cron job to auto fetch the time every one minute

## Clarifications

- I have developed the required equations to get the MSD & MTC as referenced in https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/mars24/help/algorithm.html
